# TimeAllAround

Website for checking the timezones around the world.

Resolution: 1920 x 1080

## Remarks

The website still doesn't work completely due to the CORS error. To see it working you can use the extension <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?pli=1">Moesif Origin & CORS Changer</a> and enable it.

I'm currently working to fix this error in a secondary branch.
